## Class 13: Multithreading

- Introduction to threads
- Creating threads using Thread class and Runnable interface
- Thread lifecycle and synchronization

```
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread is running!");
    }
}

public class ThreadExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread thread = new MyThread();
        thread.start();
    }
}
```

### Exercises
- Write a program that creates multiple threads to print numbers concurrently.
- Implement a synchronized method to control access to a shared resource.
