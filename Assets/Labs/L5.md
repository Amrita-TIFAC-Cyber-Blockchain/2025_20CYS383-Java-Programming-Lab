## Class 5: Object-Oriented Programming Concepts

- Introduction to OOP: classes and objects
- Attributes and methods
- Constructors

```
class Car {
    String model;
    int year;

    Car(String model, int year) {
        this.model = model;
        this.year = year;
    }
}

public class OOPExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car myCar = new Car("Toyota", 2020);
        System.out.println(myCar.model + " - " + myCar.year);
    }
}
```

### Exercises
- Create a class called Book with attributes like title, author, and price, and implement a constructor.
- Write a program that creates multiple objects of the Car class and displays their details.
